After nine months and investing over $250,000 into Project Phoenix, we are at a pivotal moment. We've simply invested too much to quit now. While initial user testing data shows a 60% drop-off rate after the first use, the feedback from the users who did stay has been unanimously positive, confirming our core hypothesis that we've built something valuable. The negative data likely comes from a user segment that doesn't grasp our revolutionary approach. The entire team is in full agreement that with one final push to add the 'Social Synergy' feature, we will overcome these initial hurdles. Our projections show that this feature alone will catapult us to 50,000 active users by the end of next quarter, a milestone that will easily secure our Series A funding."
